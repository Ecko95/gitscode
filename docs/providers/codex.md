# Codex

This guide is for people who want to use more than one Codex account in GITS.

Common reasons:

- use a work account for work projects
- use a personal account for personal projects
- switch to another account when one account hits limits
- keep one shared Codex history instead of maintaining two separate Codex setups

## I Only Use One Codex Account

Use the default provider.

In Settings, your Codex provider can stay like this:

```text
Display name: Codex
CODEX_HOME path: ~/.codex
Shadow home path: empty
```

Log in with Codex normally:

```bash
codex login
```

## I Want Work And Personal Codex Accounts

Use one real Codex home and one shadow home.

Recommended setup:

```text
~/.codex      shared Codex home
~/.codex_p    second account auth
```

The idea is:

- both accounts can see the same T3/Codex sessions
- each account keeps its own login
- existing threads can continue with either account

### Set Up The First Account

Log in normally:

```bash
codex login
```

This is the account used by `~/.codex`.

In GITS Settings, name it something obvious:

```text
Display name: Codex Work
CODEX_HOME path: ~/.codex
Shadow home path: empty
```

### Set Up The Second Account

Log in with a separate Codex home:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.codex_p
CODEX_HOME=~/.codex_p codex login
```

In GITS Settings, add another Codex provider:

```text
Display name: Codex Personal
CODEX_HOME path: ~/.codex
Shadow home path: ~/.codex_p
```

The important part is that both providers use the same `CODEX_HOME path`, but only the second one
has a `Shadow home path`.

## Which Account Am I Using?

Open Settings and look at the provider row.

GITS shows the authenticated email for providers that report one. Emails are blurred by default;
click the blurred email to reveal it.

Use display names and accent colors to make accounts easy to tell apart in the model picker.

## I Need A Different API Key Or Endpoint

API-key authentication is billed separately from a ChatGPT subscription. For subscription access on
a remote host, use the **Sign in** action in GITS Settings. GITS starts Codex's device-code flow for
that provider home; open the verification page on a trusted device and enter the one-time code.
The sign-in session is private to the initiating GITS connection and expires automatically. GITS
does not persist the device code or resulting token.

Use the provider's Environment variables section in Settings.

This is useful when a Codex-compatible setup needs account-specific variables. Add the variables to
the provider instance that should receive them, and mark API keys or tokens as sensitive. Sensitive
values are stored as server secrets and are not sent back to the app after saving.

## Authenticate A Codex MCP Server Remotely

An MCP server login is separate from Codex account login. A remote browser cannot receive an MCP
server's loopback callback directly, so GITS can relay one callback through its authenticated HTTPS
origin.

The host must advertise that origin with `T3CODE_MCP_OAUTH_CALLBACK_URL`. GITS offers the MCP
**Authenticate** action only when the URL is HTTPS and the temporary callback listener can be proven
private. Each attempt has one short-lived callback lease. GITS validates the callback state, forwards
it once to the helper, and does not persist the authorization code or token.

Unset `T3CODE_MCP_OAUTH_CALLBACK_URL` to disable only this helper. MCP inventory and ordinary Codex
sessions continue to work.

## Can I Switch Accounts In An Existing Thread?

Yes, when both Codex providers share the same `CODEX_HOME path`.

For example:

```text
Codex Work      CODEX_HOME path: ~/.codex
Codex Personal  CODEX_HOME path: ~/.codex, Shadow home path: ~/.codex_p
```

Those two providers are considered compatible for continuation, so the locked model picker can show
both.

If you add a third Codex provider with a completely different `CODEX_HOME path`, GITS treats it
as a different workspace. It will not be offered for existing threads created under `~/.codex`.

## If Both Accounts Look The Same

If two Codex providers show the same account or the same unexpected model list:

1. Check the email in Settings.
2. Refresh provider status.
3. Confirm the second provider has `Shadow home path` set.
4. Confirm the shadow directory has its own `auth.json`.
5. If you copied `~/.codex` into the shadow directory, remove everything except `auth.json`.

Example cleanup:

```bash
find ~/.codex_p -mindepth 1 ! -name auth.json -exec rm -rf {} +
```

## When To Use A Separate CODEX_HOME

Use a totally separate `CODEX_HOME path` only when you want a separate Codex workspace.

That means separate sessions and less account switching inside old threads. Most dual-account users
should use the shared-home plus shadow-home setup instead.
